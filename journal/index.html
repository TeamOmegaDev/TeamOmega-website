            <p>Day 0: Departure<br>
                <br>
                Hey Ive! If you read this, I probably am trying to cope with what happened haha... So I'm writing you a journal of everything I'm doing for each day. You'll be able to see my "incredible adventures", and I'll stop writing as soon as I hear from you. I'll be honest, I'm doing this because you also like hearing me talk about my stories, and I hope this will be of aid for your healing.<br>
                <br>
                These events start right after your fall.
                I was shocked at first. I was in disbelief, everything happened so fast, my heart is beating faster as I think about it. Everything about it, from the sound you made as you fell, to the realisation, and to your screams of pain. At first, you had no pain, then I saw the blood and adrenaline kicked in. I ran to your side and grabbed your hand. I checked every spot for wounds, and saw your leg injured. I grabbed your pretty face and saw your chin and the hole in it. Immediately when I saw the blood in your mouth, I started panicking. What if you cut your tongue? What if you broke something inside? Hopefully, there's none of that happening. I call the paramedics immediately, and tell them everything. The neighbours see us, and come down. Then the other come out as well. I explain everything to them, and they all understand. My brain calms down, and I realise the consequence of everything. Regret kicks in. Pain kicks in. But I have to stay strong. For you. The moment the paramedics come, I move out of the way. And that's the last time I saw you. The moment you're out of sight, I start panicking. The neighbor calms me down, and we start talking. They tell me everything will be fine, and that you'll be ok. I keep thinking how fucking stupid I was about all of this. About all could've been avoided if I wasn't retarded like I am. Really, a ladder? I'm so fucking smart. I give my statement to the policeman, and leave the street. Immediately after, I start crying, thinking about how you would end up. I call my best friend, but he doesn't pick up. I try everything, and he doesn't answer. I try my other best friend who's always online, and explain everything. Tears are running down my cheeks. I then call my mom, who scolds me like hell. Honestly, I deserved and still deserve all the pain in the world, so I didn't think much of it... I try and sleep. I stare at ceiling, blood on my hands and clothes. It makes me feel the guilt and the pain, so I decide to keep it on me.<br>
                <br>
                The morning. I see missed calls from my mom and my best friend. I tell my mom I'm ok, which is an obvious lie as I thought of jumping off my roof as well. Alice answers my messages. I try calling the hospital all day long. They kept putting me on hold for different services at the hospital. I stayed over the phone for hours, until they don't answer me anymore. I wanted to see you one more time before leaving, just to hold your hand and tell you that everything would be fine. I guess it didn't work. I'm sorry. For everything. I didn't drink water today, sorry.. I only drank my Dr. Pepper and chocolate milk, had to finish them before leaving. I made a small bag of items I'm leaving as a goodbye gift. Maybe you'll be happier with them? Yes, I included my hat, I look cute in it for you but I want you to have it for now. You'll give it back to me on Christmas, if you still plan on doing whatever you want to do.<br>
                <br>
                I finally fall asleep at 5PM. I wish I didn't. I get stuck in a infinite nightmare. You keep falling from the roof infront of me. Again and again. More and more bruised everytime. The voices in my head intensify. They keep blaming me. And I can't blame them, it is my fault. 100%. I have no excuse whatsoever, you have 0% of responsibility in this. And with my guilt and anger towards myself growing bigger, I feel more and more pain. My chest gets tighter, and I breathe faster and faster. I'm woken up by the pain in my chest. I'm sweating and crying. I start packing my stuff, and get everything ready.<br>
                <br>
                I just left home. The time? 2:43AM. Gave a goodbye hug to my host, and with my heart weighting me down, I started walking towards my worst nightmare; Your street. Somehow, during the day it looks almost nostalgic. But at night? I am terrified. Everytime I close my eyes, I see you fall. Over and over again. So when I saw that I had to cross your street to go to my bus stop, I stopped for a second. My stomach tied up as I engaged into Cromwell Road. I'll be honest, the first thing I did was check the roof. I wanted to see if you were awake or in your room. I just wanted to hear from you, know that you're doing well, or even just wanted to know that you were alive and breathing. With my fist clenched, and a ball down my throat, I checked the place where you fell. At first, I thought I saw you there. For a minute, I really thought I saw you laying down there, smiling at me. But then, you started bleeding??? I look around me, and everything is spinning. My whole world was shaking, and I could barely stand on my feet. A quick look around made me realise the place was covered with blood. My hands, still unwashed from yesterday, are still covered with the dirt from the ladder, and the blood from your fall. I look up, and you're bleeding even more. I grab my clothes and try to stop the bleeding. I whisper that everything's gonna be ok, but as I look up to you, your eyes are injected with blood. I hear whispering, and panic. I look around and start breathing heavily, look for the person whispering in my ears. I then focus on the voice, trying to ignore the screams of pain you're letting out. Then I hear it; The voice. It's one of my best friends, Anthony. He speaks to me and say: remember, breathe in slowly, keep it in, breathe out slowly. My vision unblurred, I check my surrounding. You vanished. I find myself a mile after your home, not realising I've been walking on auto pilot this entire time; It was all in my head. Sweating, I try and talk to my friend over the phone to calm myself down. I keep walking and look constantly at my map, slowly realising I'm not doing any progress on the trail. For some reason, it kept zooming in, again and again, making the way to the bus stop seem infinite. I talk more and more to my friend, trying my best to keep my anxiety levels low. The walk was 10 minutes long. It felt like hours though, which did not help with the pain I was feeling. I should've jumped under you. I should've tried so much more than grabbing you on your way down. I would do anything to take your pain and wounds for myself. I almost thought of jumping down as well funnily enough. But then I heard your voice telling me not to... And I remembered. How much you care and love for me. How you looked at me, smiling when you were bleeding out. At no point you showed anger towards me. I just wish I could've held your hand, one. last. time. I reached it. The end of your street. I let out a sigh of relief, as I give your street one last look. I made it. I then start asking myself, what does the letter mean on the Maps itinerary. Apparently, you guys label the bus stop with letters on top of the name? I wait there while debating whether Anthony and I would survive Sword Art Online. We come up with all sorts of plan and strategies on how we would survive, xp, and make profit.. wait no that's me alone, he only mentioned survival and leveling up. I finally see my bus arrive, and realise I can't use cash; So as a way to get myself past the guy, I first try sliding my card infront of him, but then I see a green light! Huh..? How did my card work, I'm supposed to have no money! Well, I just go along with it. On the bus ride, I realise I forgot the marmelade for my mom at home! Thinking about it, I probably forgot my phone charger as well, I should check my bag... Also, very funny, I began having pain from trying to stop your fall in my arms. And leg pain. But I didn't tell you that last time to not make you worry about me haha...<br>
                <br>
                After some troublesome adventures with buses (Maps mislead me and I ended up at the wrong place, which led to me missing the bus yippee..). I finally am on my National Express, going back to the airport. I checked the bag for my charger and realised I forgot it as well as my marmelade... Welp, I don't think I'll have time to buy some at the airport sadly, so my mom will have to wait for me to come back here to buy her some. Alice should go to my hosts house to get you some stuff for you on Thursday. I hope you'll be back by then. For now, I'll listen to music while typing the first bit of today's journal. I forgot to write the beginning...<br>
                <br>
                Finally on the highway. I finished writing the beginning of the journal. I hope I won't be late to the airport... I'll keep you updated.<br>
                <br>
                If you see a new paragraph, just understand it's me writing something new (like after some time, so there's a difference in the timestamp).<br>
                <br>
                I'll try my best to find a job to do with my studies at the same time. That way I can find a good job after I'm done with my studies, and I can stack up some money to get you out of there when you're 18. Maybe we can start looking for a place to live together later? I don't know if you want to, but I will anyway. I also started thinking about a way to host the journal somewhere. I think I'll do a secret page on my website.<br>
                <br>
                I arrived at the airport. Had to double check my bag at security, which meant I.. (you guessed it), MISSED MY FLIGHT, YIPPEE... So I struggled trying to get a refund, which didn't go through.. so I had to pay a plane ticket for tomorrow.. So I've been waiting all day at the airport. Tried to sleep a bit, but I woke up to my best friend writing me a VERY long message to tell me he was disgusted by me and my behaviour and called me a pedo, which is so cool yay awesome.. I guess I should choose my friends better? Glad I still have Anthony though. So yeah, I love my life 💔</p>
